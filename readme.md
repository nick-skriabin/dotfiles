## What's included

This is a list of everything that I use daily or somewhat often. Some of the apps on this list run in background or launched on system start.
I've been tailoring my system for years. Now I'm finally at the point where I'm almost 100% satisfied with it.

#### Terminal of choice - Kitty

<img src="./assets/kitty.png" alt="kitty terminal" width="100%" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 16px;"/>
I'm spending most of the time in the terminal, so this is the most tailored place of them all.

GPU accelerated terminal emulator. I used iTerm2, Alacritty, Wezterm and kitty. The last one turned out to be perfect for. More about kitty.

### UI and system navigation

#### For those who's missing i3 on mac - Aerospace

<img src="./assets/aerospace.gif" alt="aeEospace" width="100%" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 16px;"/>
Aerospace is a tiling window manager for Mac. It is basically a i3 alternative for macOS. While there are little quircks, Aerospace
gets the job done. Vertical and horizontal splits, workspaces, window layouts, you name it. What's even cooler is that you can use key bindings
to perform different actions. In my case, I use it as an app launcher as well.

#### Personalized status bar - Sketchybar

<img src="./assets/sketchybar.png" alt="sketchybar" width="100%" width="100%" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 16px;"/>

Sketchybar is a customizable status bar replacement for macOS. It allows you to display system information, notifications, and more in a sleek and efficient manner.

#### Because default focus indication on Mac sucks - Borders

<img src="./assets/borders.gif" alt="borders" width="100%" width="100%" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 16px;"/>
Borders is a utility for managing window borders on your desktop. It enhances the visual separation between windows, making multitasking more intuitive.

### Utilities worth mentioning

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Fuzzy finder. You can pipe pretty much any list of strings into it and search through.
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) - Smarter `cd`. It remembers directories you visited and allow fuzzy `cd`. E.g., if I type `z dot` it will `cd ~/Git/dotfiles`
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) - A drop-in replacement for `ls`. Supports tree view, icons, friendly formatting and more.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - TMUX allows you to spawn long-sessions that will continue working in the background even if you close your terminal
